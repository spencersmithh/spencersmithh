### Financial Data Extractor

* Unable to provide source code as it's protected under NDA.

### [Virtual Internet](https://github.com/spencersmithh/JavaVLAN)
* A semester long project which simulates operations such as router table sharing, switch subnet checks, distance vectors, and more. Works on same host and across different hosts on the same network.

### [Chess Bot](https://github.com/spencersmithh/Chessbot)
* Chess bot that utilizes the Java library [chesslib](https://github.com/bhlangonijr/chesslib) and a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to simulate a chess game.

### [Quaternary Calculator](https://github.com/spencersmithh/QuaternaryCalculator)
* Calculator designed to perform arithmetic operations on quaternary (base-4) numbers. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and square root of quaternary numbers. It also allows users to toggle the display between quaternary and decimal (base-10) number systems.

### [Multithreaded File Service](https://github.com/Lukas-Maynard/Multithreaded-File-Service)
* A simple file sharing and management program using multiple threads to maximize efficiency. Project was done almost entirely via pair-programming during in-class workshop sessions.
